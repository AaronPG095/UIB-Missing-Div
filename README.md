# **UIB Final Project:** Missing Div

## Our Project:

As our group project we decided to create a website for our new band, **Missing <> Div**. Through our Web-Dev course, we have all been inspired by the intricacies of html element (dis)placement, our band name being a tribute to our daily struggles with syntax.

1. Share information about the band, and improve publicity.
2. Keep fans informed and up to date about new gigs.
